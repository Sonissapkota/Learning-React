**useCallback Hook:**
The `useCallback` hook memoizes a function, returning the same instance of that function instead of creating a new one with every render. However, the component or function may re-render when the specified dependencies change. A function using `useCallback` will only re-render if its dependencies have changed, effectively "freezing" it from unnecessary renders.

**Difference between useCallback and useEffect Hooks:**
While `useEffect` also relies on dependencies, it is designed specifically for handling side effectsâ€”such as data fetching, DOM manipulations, or other logic that should run after rendering or when dependencies change. In contrast, `useCallback` is intended for memoizing functions to prevent their re-creation on every render, particularly when these functions are passed as props to child components. 

**Use Cases:**
- **useCallback:** Use this hook to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-creations, especially when passing these functions as props to child components.
- **useEffect:** Use this hook for side effects, such as data fetching, updating the DOM, or running any code that should execute after rendering or when certain dependencies change.
